# Organ Donation (Group16)

# OverView

"Half of all Canadians are fit to donate blood, but only 1 in 60 Canadians gave blood last year. Our organ donation rates are also lower than many countries, including the United States."[1] This fact alone tells the reality of organ donation in Canada. The truth about organ donation is same in the rest of the world. In 2016, 260 people died in Canada due to lack of the organ transplant [1]. One of the primary reason behind 260 deaths, is lack of the centralised system that covers hospitals in pan Canada with information of organ donors and receivers. There are many government and non-profit organisation which survey the Canadian and found that ninety percent are in agreement to donate an organ. However, only twenty percent have pledged to register for the organ donation. According to doctors a single donor can save more than eight lives and benefit 75 other people. In 2016, 1717 fatal road accidents occurred in 2016[2], organs from these people could have saved many lives.

We came up with a solution in which can resolve the problem of organ donation. We want to make a web portal that connects all the hospitals in pan Canada, where hospitals can upload the requirements of organ transplant and people can take the pledge to donate their organ. This web application will help hospitals to connect to the other hospitals so that they can search the required donor available. Whenever any requirement of organ transplant comes, hospitals can explore the options available on the web application and connect to the donors through hospitals for the further steps. The basic workflow of the application is donors will register on the web application or hospitals can register the people on the who are dead due to accidents or who are dying and are living and willing to donate their organ. In the case of any organ requirement, hospitals will search the web application to find the donors. The hospital will connect with the donor's hospital with the complete patient requirement. Now, donor's hospital will ask donor availability for current availability for organ donation transplant. If donor agrees to donate, then the hospital will conduct all the test on the donor.  After the all the medical examination on donors and reports would be fed to the system. Description of medical examination would be resister in the system. The system will do two tasks simultaneously; first, it will send the report to the patient's hospital. The second purpose that will resolve is to create a record in the application, and it will remove the hassle of conducting examination again. 

The application has a promise to save many lives. It will reduce the death caused by the lack of organ to be transplanted. Web Application, connect all the hospitals which reduce the pain area of searching for the donor. It will also create a repository of records which could be used by other hospitals.
